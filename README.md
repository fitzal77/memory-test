## Website Description
Test your short-term recall. This is a quick procedure to check for cognitive impairment. 

A Three Word Recall Test to assess an individual's ability to remember and recall information in the short-term. This type of test is often used as a quick screening tool to evaluate an individual's cognitive function, particularly their ability to form and maintain new memories. The ability to recall information after a short delay is a key aspect of cognitive function and is important in many everyday activities. In clinical settings, the 3-word test can be a useful tool for assessing cognitive impairment or dementia, as these conditions often impact an individual's short-term memory.

### Word List
The words in the list are a subset of the 5000 most commonly used English words, based on the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA).
The chosen words are nouns, verbs, and adjectives, filtered by a list of swear words and words with a strongly negative connotation. 
The list was further filtered for only non-proper words 4-10 characters in length with some of the more idiosyncratic words removed. 
Some 3-letter words were added back in.
